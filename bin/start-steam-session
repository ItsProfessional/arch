# Inconsistent rarely functional. Big time waster.
# 
# -nested-refresh needed to increase above default 60
# -console is needed for quit command
# -gamepadui is required, will not show game when launched from normal version until big picture selected
# -fullscreen appears to be needed for adaptive sync
# adaptive sync sometimes functional: vsync must be disabled
# HDR appears sometimes functional: shows disabled in game
#
# game must be explicitly set to native resolution, output and nested resolution args not needed, don't seem to work
