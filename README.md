I use Arch Linux and [suckless](http://suckless.org/) is my "desktop environment", using the [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/) window manager.

Arch installation instructions and user configuration for desktop, laptop and embedded usage.

My tools/configurations:
* [dwm](https://github.com/alex-courtis/dwm/)
* [slstatus](https://github.com/alex-courtis/slstatus/)
* [xlayoutdisplay](https://github.com/alex-courtis/xlayoutdisplay/)

# Usage

## Install

```sh
git clone git@github.com:alex-courtis/arch.git ~/.dotfiles
RCRC="${HOME}/.dotfiles/rcrc" rcup -v
```

## Usage

See [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) for details on dotfile management.

# Note To Users

If you wish to use these dotfiles, it is advisable to fork this repository. I frequently make large and breaking changes.
